## HOW TO DO THE COLLABORATIVE PROJECT

1. Go to github website and sigh in Create the printf repository (only one partner should create)
a. Then copy and paste the link for your partner to clone.
2. git clone the https:
3. change directory into printf using cd printf.
4. Do the git config user.emal "zayadsamuel@gmail.com"
5. Do the git config user.name "Your name"
6. Go to setting of the repo and click on collaboration.
7. Add your partner or collaborator.
8. Ask your partner to accept invitation.

## This task has about 13 to 15 files.. One partner will have 7 files while the other will have 6 files

a. The first partner will create his/her files in the local and then
b. The following run git add .
c. git commit -m "Updated"
d. git push

## Ask the second partner to run git pull to receive your files. When second partner is done pulling ask he or she to create their own files
run the steps a,b,c.

## At this point the first partner has to do the git pull to receive the remaining
files locally.

## When both of you now have a total of 13 files, the one who pushed the least number
of files should do this.

## Create the main.c file
1. copy the script given below in the task page an then run the gcc code
This is the gcc code gcc-wall -Wextra -Werror -padentic -stdrgrd9 -woo-farmat *.c

2. if no error detected by the gcc code, it will create a new file called a.out therefore you now have 2 new file main.c & a.out then do steps a,b,c,d to push to github

3. The other partner who previously pushed more files can now do a fresh git pull to receive main.c and a.out files

4. Then go back to your task page and start running your checker. ALL GREENS.
